# Breach probability prediction

## Introduction

You are given a dataset of breaches that occurred between years 2012 and 2016.
This dataset only includes breaches of publicly traded companies.
Your task is to predict the probability that a company will be breached in 2017.

The dataset is included in this repository ([breach_dataset.tsv](breach_dataset.tsv))

## Evaluation

The primary metric for evaluating your predictions will be [logloss](https://www.kaggle.com/wiki/LogLoss).
However, we also will also consider your overall approach and the methods used.

You can find the overview of the dataset and also how to calculate logloss in the included **IPython/Jupyter** notebook:
[predicting_breach_probability.ipynb](predicting_breach_probability.ipynb).

# How to submit a solution

Send us a link to the github repo with your solution to mlprague@ceai.io with subject "TowerStreet breach prediction".
Your solution should include:
* all the code you used for data preparation and training
* evaluation of your solution
* approach description and your final score in the readme of your repository

You are free to use any tool or language you like.

**Deadline: 2nd May 23:59:59 CEST.**
